- "Cant find glfw3.dll" error at runtime. Had to copy that file from "glfw-3.4.bin.WIN32\lib-static-ucrt" to build folder manually according to glfw docs.

1. just walk forward on the solid grouhnd. That's it. This is the end. Or is it? Edning 1/4.
2. walk on a jelly ground. you are able to jump now. jump with ability of jumping downwards to boost you height jump. That's it. This is the end. Or is it? Edning 2/4.
3. You are on ice now. You jump, bump dowwards. Break the ice. Get frozed in the cold water. That's it. This is the end. Or is it? Edning 3/n.
4. you are on the boat now in the middle of the ocean. That's it. This is the end. Or is it? Edning 4/n..
5. no, really this is it for now. thanks for playing.




-- NIGHTMARE happened at night 28.02.2025 - 01.03.2025 --
train dark with uncle Kolya. dark wagon, full of teens or young adults. i have one ear headphones, lost the other
half of the pair. one girl is attractive and is near me and watching at me. a mirror on the wall. at some point
we kiss each other. then we go the toilet to do something involving her mouth and my not mouth. after some time
she laughs, looks at me with ammetist eyes with no pupils and spreads something with her hand over my face. its
that amethyst looking spread. now im blinded as well. i walk back alone, scream and noone notice me. i look at
the mirror and see myself there chatting with that girl earlier. i scream again at the mirror, only that girl
looks at me with a smile. so im on the other side of the mirror, cool. then something happens involving train
stop, me driving a track and crashing it to attract attention and something with that wireless ears i have irl
and cant remember anything more.
